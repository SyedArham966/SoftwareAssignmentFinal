# Additional Data Source Research

The following links were discovered while looking for player statistic APIs and scraping tools:

* **ThunderAPI** – <https://github.com/Suomalainen1976/thunderapi>
  * A Node.js scraper that retrieves player and squadron information from War Thunder.
* **warthunder-scraper** – <https://github.com/pim97/warthunder-scraper>
  * Uses the Scrappey service to scrape user profiles from Warthunder.com.
* **Open Source API forum thread** – <https://forum.warthunder.com/t/open-source-api/72519>
  * Mentions a GitHub project called `wtpt-api`, but the repository seems to have been removed.

These projects are community-maintained and typically rely on scraping the official website. Using them may violate War Thunder's Terms of Service, so check the policies carefully before relying on scraped data.
